# Binance Coin

### Overview and Origin
 
The company I choose is Binance and the BNB coin.
Binance was Incorporated on July 2017 by Changpeng Zhao


Binance is the largest crypto exhange in terms of daily trading volumes of cryptocurrencies. BNB coin started out as a vehicle to raise funds for the binance exchange. The coin serves as a cheaper alternative to paying fees on the binance exchange.


Binance is funded by 8 investors, "vertex Ventures Southeast Asia & india" and "Vertex Ventures China" are the more newer investors. Binance has rasied a total of $3b.


## Business Activities

 The SEC sued bianace saying that it was running a illigal securitys exchange in the Unites States. The SEC said that Binance was offering tokens that were acutally securities and not registered as such. That led to Traders and investors withdrawing billions of dollars from the crypto exchange.

Binance is for all kinds of investors and traders looking to buy and sell cryptocurrencies."About 21 percent of American adults have owned cryptocurrency as of 2022, according to NBC news."

Binance uses blockchain technology and Dual Chain Architecture for its BNB token.
"Binance Smart Chain is a blockchain network launched by Binance on September 2020. It is designed to be a high-performance blockchain that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and supports smart contracts." Dual Chain Architecture was created to eliminate the flaws of the blockchain system. Binance Smart Chain is built on proof of stake and dual chain architecture which allows it to provide faster transaction speeds and low transaction costs.

## Landscape



Binance is in the blockchain/crypto currency industry

### Major trends and innovations

1) Defi:
Decentralized finance uses cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to manage financial transactions. Defi cuts out the banks for lending, borrowing and trading, giving more power to the people.


2) NFT:
"Non-fungible tokens are used to represent ownership of unique items"


3) StableCoins
"Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to another asset class to keep a stable, steady value." It is usally tied to the U.S dollar.


 Some of the major companies are Coinbase, Kucoin, and Kraken.


## Results


"In most cases, a Binance listing does have a positive impact on a cryptocurrency's price." Prices of a newly listed crypto currency usally rise on the first day of the listing.

"Measuring the success of a blockchain project involves assessing technical metrics like transaction speed, scalability, and security. It also considers real-world impact, user adoption, and engagement. Efficiency gains, cost reduction, and transparency improvements are key indicators." The BNB coin has a large number of transactions without sacrificing speed or security.


It is outperforming all the competitors as it is the largest crypto exchange in terms of daily trading volume.


## Recommendations


I would advise them to make the bnb coin more decentralised.


BNB is extremely centralized and if they made it decentralized it would provide users with more control. In the crypto space many investors and traders prefer a decentralized coin.
